## 📌 1. Endpoints Protection Using Reinforcement Learning <a name="epurl"></a>
We use reinforcement learning with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) in a simulated environment to train an autonomous defense agent. This agent dynamically responds to threats, improving endpoint security over time with minimal human intervention.

## 📌 2. Malware Generation and Detection Using GAN <a name="mgdug"></a>
Malware Generation and Detection using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) leverages the power of deep learning to create synthetic malware samples for training detection systems. The generator in a GAN produces malware variants, while the discriminator learns to identify them. This approach helps improve the robustness of detection models by exposing them to a wide variety of attack patterns, including those that have not yet been seen in real-world attacks.

## 📌 3. Network Traffic Analysis Using LSTM <a name="ntaul"></a>
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks analyze network traffic, detect anomalies, and provide real-time alerts on suspicious patterns, ensuring a robust network defense layer.

## 📌 4. Phishing Mails Detection Using NLP and Data Augmentation <a name="pmd"></a>
 We propose an integrated NLP model for phishing email detection consisting of three major components: Tokenization, Stopword Removal, and the Multinomial Naive Bayes Classifier.

## 📌 5. IP Profiling Detection Using Unsupervised Learning <a name="ipp"></a>
The IP Profiling Model extracts key features like packet rate, IP frequency, and protocol usage to identify behavioral patterns. It uses K-means clustering to group IPs based on similar behavior and SVM for classification, distinguishing normal from suspicious activity. <br>Isolation Forest detects outliers to spot unusual IP behaviors, providing additional anomaly detection. This combination allows for effective identification of network anomalies.
