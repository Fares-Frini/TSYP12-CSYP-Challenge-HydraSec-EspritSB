    <i>Network Traffic Analysis Using LSTM</i>
</p>

---

## üìù Overview
The **Network Traffic Analysis Using LSTM** module is part of the HydraSec cybersecurity suite. This module employs **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** networks to analyze network traffic and detect anomalies or potential cyber threats in real-time. LSTM is well-suited for this task due to its ability to remember past events and capture sequential patterns in time-series data, making it ideal for network traffic analysis.
